This is the story about a little robot called Jumper. Jumper lives in a dark little room of a mattress factory, where he tests the durability of mattresses by jumping on each mattress rolling over a conveyor belt. But he feels sad. He wonders what the outside world would look like. 

Then one day, he discovers a glitch in the wall, and escapes to freedom. There he explores the world, and discovers that he can manipulate objects by coding.

Gameplay

The game will be a 2D platformer in which multiple elements are programmable, the goal is to finish jumping puzzles through modifying objects and enemies with code and commands. By adding collectables and unlockables we will make the game more appealing and fun.
